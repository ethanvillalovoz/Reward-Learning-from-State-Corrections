# Reward-Learning-from-State-Corrections
Research project from the CMU Robotics Institute Summer Scholars (RISS) Program, exploring reward learning from state corrections in human-robot interaction. This work investigates how robots can use clarification questions to align actions with human preferences, enhancing adaptability and efficiency in dynamic environments.
